#Task 2: Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) Creation

#Develop an ERD to visually represent the relationships between the tables in your schema.
#Highlight key relationships such as the link between Books and Authors, 
# and Customers and Transactions.
#Use standard ERD notation to illustrate one-to-many and many-to-one relationships.










#Expected Outcome: A clear and detailed ERD that accurately reflects 
# the relationships within the "BookHaven" database.
